in this MATLAB project a model for silicon Pn Junction uniformly doped ,the motion of electrons and holes and the neutral region
And a three animations for energy band in its three cases thermal equilibrium , forward bias and reverse bias
and calculation for built in potential ,electric field_max,depletion width,xno,xpo,npo and pno
